The aim of this project is to develop a user-friendly Health Data Tracker application that allows individuals to input their weight and height in order to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). This application is designed using Python and its Tkinter library, providing an accessible way for users to monitor their health metrics.
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used method to assess body weight relative to height. It serves as an important indicator for determining whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Understanding one's BMI can motivate individuals to adopt healthier lifestyle choices.
